# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction

This project uses a Logistic Regression model to classify sonar signals as either "Rock" or "Mine". The dataset consists of sonar signal data, where each feature represents a frequency response. The goal is to predict whether the signal corresponds to a rock or a mine, which is critical in sonar detection systems, such as for marine exploration or mine detection.
**Project Overview**

This project uses the Sonar Data to train a logistic regression model that classifies sonar signals into two categories:

Rock (R)
Mine (M)
The model is trained using the features in the dataset, and the performance is evaluated on both training and test data. Once trained, the model is used to predict the type of object (Rock or Mine) based on a given sonar signal.
**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is the Sonar Data. It contains 60 features, each representing a sonar signal, and one target variable (column 60), which can either be "R" for Rock or "M" for Mine. The dataset is available as a CSV file.
